# TestAutomator
For the automated testing of a mixer, I designed a device with a display and modifiable parameters that would run cycles at different speeds and settings, customizable by the user. 

In order to perform this task, I used the Adafruit Magtag 2.9 microcontroller along with its 2.9" Grayscale E-Ink WiFi Display, an Adafruit TBB6612 Stepper Motor Driver, and a linear actuator. 

First, I designed the display (as seen below) with the help of the ThinkInk library. After this, I programmed the four buttons on the bottom so that the user can change the number of cycles that they want the test to run for, as well as the setting of the mixer during a set of cycles.
